A [Flarum](http://flarum.org) extension. Checklists for Flarum! If you can edit posts with checklists, you can click them to toggle without having to open the edit composer.
Integrates particularly well with [Flarum Rich Text Editor](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/26455-wysiwyg-rich-text-editor) but does not require it.
